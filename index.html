                Pride and Fall is a total conversion mod for grand strategy game Hearts of Iron IV,<br> located in post-collapse Poland in year 2027.<br>
                Central Government has failed and people with different beliefs and goals decided to<br> asses control in their small regions to help people, keep themselves in power or <br>change entirety of Polish society for decades to come.
                <br><br>
                Save Poland or change its face forever...</p>

        <p>Our aim is to release the demo version of PaF before September 1st which would focus around Łódzkie Voivodeship.<br><br>

Your main goal will be unifying Voivodeship, But you also need to prepare for new threat. Threat that is awakening in Subcarpathian region. Someone, or rather something that wants to recreate a Poland in a much... gruesome way.</p>
